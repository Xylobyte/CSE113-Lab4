1.) x=2 y=1 z=1
    x=2 y=2 z=1
    x=2 y=2 z=2
    x=0 y=-1 z=0
    x=0 y=0 z=-1
    x=0 y=-1 z=-1

2.) On line 13 there is a "-" in the function name. This will generate an error when compiling since this is not allowed.

3.) This program will print out a single 1 and then nothing else because it will first executes once then will stop since 
it only executes "while(false)"

4.) The output is going to be "f is NOT 1.0" because the variable f was instantiated as 0.0 outside of the for loop, but 
since any changes to it were made inside, this does not affect the actual value. Therefore it is always 0.0 outside of 
the loop.

5.) On line 5 there is an attempt to assign both 1 and 2 to the variable a. This is invalid since it can only hold one value 
and the compiler would state that "2" is not a valid statement.

6.) The output will be "size of array is: 8" because the array is not yet instantiated. Therefore it is not storing any additional 
values.

7.) The first function call is ok with taking a character regardless of the format as long as it is a character. The second one however 
requires that there is a space before the character.

8.) i : 10
    sizeof(i++) is: 4
    i : 10
This is the case because sizeof() returns the size in bytes, so it is not affected by an increment of 1 in the value since it does 
not affect the type of the variable. i remains 10 afterwards because of scope.

9.)
#include <stdio.h> 
int main()
{
    int day,month,year;
    printf("Enter the date (dd-mm-yyyy) format including -'s:");
    scanf("%d-%d-%d",&day,&month,&year);
    printf("The date you have entered is %02d-%02d-%d\n", day,month,year);
    return 0;
}

10.) To fix this, replace the "i--" in for loop with "n--" this will itterate 20 times.

11.) This produces a compiller error because a was never instantiated but the program 
attempted to run operations on it.

12.) The output is 8 because when checking the value of ++i the first time, both "(++i < 7)" 
and "( i++/6)" need to be true, but since the first statement was wrong the second one was never 
checked. The second time is "(++i <= 9)" where i became 8.
