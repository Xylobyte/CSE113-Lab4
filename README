Lab 4

Purpose: To experiment with the GNU debugger and use it to find and fix bugs within programs.

Conclusions:

a) What I learned from this lab:
I learned how to utilize the GNU debugger to find bugs within programs so 
that I may fix them. This is useful in the real world because debugging bigger 
and more complex programs will require keeping track of various variables and 
figuring out what is wrong. Therefore, this lab was very informative and it 
taught me a lot that I can use in the future.

b) How did the pair programming help/hinder the lab:
Pair: This helped me debug the sorting algorithms because I got an idea of what 
the program is supposed to do. Working with different sorting algorithms enabled me 
to see these bugged programs from another point of view. This was helpful.

c) Issues and how I fixed them (bug report):
I fiex the bugged programs by debugging them using the GNU debugging method.

d) Improvements that can be made:
In the future, I think get a better grasp on how to use the debugger in other ways 
such as conditional breaks.
